<hr/>

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Management Tool:
We used Discord for communication and [Github Project/Issues](https://github.com/uoa-compsci399-2025-s1/capstone-project-2025-s1-team-6/issues) for task tracking.

## üì± About:
LOOP is a social media platform designed for neuro-diverse students at the University of Auckland. Loop was coined as a solution to a problem most people would never consider. Through our conducted research, we determined that common social media platforms today are too over-stimulating, cluttered, and messy for users with neurodiversity. To solve this problem, we propose LOOP - a social media platformed designed with inclusivity at its forefront, to be accomodating for all neurodiverse users to post, share common interests, and connect with each other in a non-confrontational manner.

## üîÆ Future Plans:

### **Expand Beyond UoA:**
  - Extend Loop to other universities across Aotearoa 
  - Implement scalable, non-UoA specific authentication 
  - Establish moderation strategies to preserve safety and inclusivity


### **Integration with Support Services:**
  - Optional connection to Inclusive Learning, and other relvant support services


### **Gamification:** 
- Loop has the potential to foster ongoing, positive user engagement through gamified elements. 
  Future features could include:
  - Participation badges 
  - Community milestones
  - Engagement streaks
- These mechanisms could help foster a sense of belonging and encouragement, especially for users who might be hesitant 
  to engage at first.


### **Backend Improvements:**
- **Security:** 
    - Add Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance account protection.
    - Implement email verification to ensure valid and trusted user accounts.


- **Notification:** Enable push or in-app notifications for:
    - New messages
    - Event updates and reminder for users rsvp'd events
    - Announcements
    

  - **Image/media sharing:** Expand messaging functionality to include:
    - Image sharing
    - Video sharing

- **Expand Accessibility Features:**
  - While Loop already supports several accessibility features such as dark/light 
  mode for visual comfort and a session timer to aid time awareness (particularly helpful for users with ADHD) there is
  strong potential to go further. Future improvements could include text-to-speech functionality, custom font selection, 
  and dynamic text scaling to better support diverse reading and communication needs.
